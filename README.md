# Orb
 #### Ethereum Name Service Bulk Queries.

A bulk query application for the Ethereum Name Service Network. Visit ens.orb to try it out!


## Notes

#### Addresses

It doesn’t matter whether or not you include
the ens ‘.eth’ extension, the app will handle
whatever you enter accordingly.

Toggling the 'Remove Invalid Characters' button
will remove all characters that will inevitably
turn up an invalid, and ultimately
unregisterable address.


#### Registration/Expiry Dates

These values just represent the most recent
registration or expiry date, if there isn't
one, it'll be represented as '--', meaning
the name has never been registered before.


#### Availability

Availability is represented by three colours:

* Red : Unavailable
* Orange : Premium
* Green : Available
* Grey : Invalid


#### Requests

This is probably going to be a pretty niche
utility, but if you do have a request for a
feature that you'd like to be added: just submit
a issue on the Github.
